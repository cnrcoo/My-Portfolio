## Introduction

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

In this project, I created a very simple, yet functional OpenSea clone.

## Getting Started

Install all the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

***Be sure that you have the [`Metamask Wallet Extension`](https://metamask.io/) in your browser installed.***
